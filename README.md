# Hospitality Performance Analysis USING SQL

A SQL-based data analysis project focused on uncovering insights from hospitality reservation data, including pricing trends, booking behavior, occupancy, cancellations, and revenue performance across multiple properties.

---

##  Project Overview

The hospitality industry relies heavily on data-driven decisions to optimize pricing, improve occupancy, and maximize revenue. This project analyzes reservation-level data using SQL to provide actionable insights for hotel and property management teams.

---

##  Problem Statement

Hospitality businesses generate large volumes of booking and reservation data, but often lack clear visibility into:

* How room rates vary across time, properties, and rate types
* Which properties and room types drive the most revenue
* Booking behaviors across different channels
* Factors influencing cancellations and no-shows

---

##  Objectives

* Analyze average room rates across months, properties, weekdays, and weekends
* Understand reservation patterns by room type and property
* Evaluate booking channel performance
* Examine the impact of special requests on booking outcomes
* Identify high-performing properties by bookings, occupancy, and revenue
* Assess revenue distribution across properties and room types

---

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Database:** MySQL
* **Language:** SQL
* **Dataset:** Hospitality.csv

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Areas

* **Room Rate Analysis** – Monthly trends, weekday vs weekend pricing, highest and lowest priced properties
* **Reservation & Stay Analysis** – Stay duration, guest composition, room type usage
* **Booking Channel Analysis** – Channel-wise booking patterns over time
* **Special Requests Analysis** – Relationship between requests, completion status, and room types
* **Cancellation & No-Show Analysis** – Risk patterns by property and channel
* **Occupancy & Revenue Analysis** – Property-level occupancy and revenue contribution

---

##  Key Findings

* Room rates show clear monthly and seasonal variations.
* Certain properties consistently command higher average room rates.
* Weekend and weekday pricing differs, reflecting demand-based pricing strategies.
* Some booking channels generate higher booking volumes but also higher cancellation or no-show rates.
* A small number of properties contribute a significant share of total revenue.
* Specific room types attract more special requests and longer stays.

---

##  Recommendations

* Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on seasonality and demand patterns.
* Focus marketing and operational efforts on high-revenue properties.
* Optimize booking channel partnerships based on performance and reliability.
* Improve handling of special requests to enhance guest satisfaction.
* Introduce measures to reduce cancellations and no-shows, such as reminders or stricter policies.
* Use occupancy insights for better staffing and capacity planning.

## Business Impact

This analysis enables hospitality stakeholders to:

* Improve pricing decisions
* Increase occupancy and revenue
* Reduce booking risks
* Enhance overall guest experience
